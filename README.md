# Oracle Investment Risk Model

## 1. Introduction

This project aims to develop an integrated analytics system to evaluate financial and investment risk through Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in various countries and simulated companies within a global economic context.

FDI refers to investments made by foreign economic agents in a local economy. FDI was chosen as the main variable because it is a key driver of economic growth and involves interactions between multiple agents: foreign investors and locally established investment companies.

Using tools such as Python, Oracle SQL, and Power BI, the project builds a comprehensive model to simulate future revenues, identify risk patterns, and generate automated alerts for critical scenarios.

This project reflects the integration of academic training in Economics and Finance with technical skills in Software Development (DAM). It demonstrates how data analysis can be applied to real-world financial settings through techniques such as Monte Carlo simulation, Value at Risk (VaR), standard deviation, and Altman's Z-Score.

## 2. Project Objectives

- Simulate future revenues for countries and companies using probabilistic techniques.
- Calculate key risk metrics: standard deviation, VaR, and Altman Z-Score.
- Store results in a relational Oracle database optimized for analytics.
- Implement triggers to detect abnormal risk scenarios.
- Visualize data through a Power BI dashboard with interactive maps and charts.
- Deploy a functional API using FastAPI to access data externally.
- Present a complete and professional data workflow integrating programming, databases, visualization, and web deployment.

## 5. Results and Analysis

### 5.1 Country-Level Analysis

**Top 5 Countries by Average FDI (2020â€“2024)**

1. **Ireland** â€“ 19.04%
2. **Netherlands** â€“ 18.42%
3. **Belgium** â€“ 10.65%
4. **European Union** â€“ 4.39%
5. **Portugal** â€“ 3.96%

**Exceptional Peak in Ireland (2015)** Ireland showed the highest standard deviation due to an unusual spike in 2015, coinciding with massive investment inflows.

**Context:**

- Between 2014â€“2015, Ireland's FDI stock doubled to â‚¬796B.
- Driven by multinational accounting movements (e.g., Apple).
- Institutional factors include 12.5% corporate tax and financial incentives (IFSC).

**Interpretation:** Structural and fiscal policies can amplify volatility. The average remains high, but dispersion is skewed by this outlier.

**Lowest FDI Countries (2020â€“2024)**

- **Greece** â€“ 1.17%
- **Italy** â€“ 1.19%
- **USA** â€“ 1.73%
- **France** â€“ 2.20%
- **China** â€“ 2.42%

**Notes:**

- Greece's persistent low levels reflect structural recovery challenges.
- Italy showed a steep decline in 2020 (COVID-related).

**Python Graphs:**

![Python Revenue Simulation](img/python/fdi_comparativo_bloque3.png)

**Interpretation:** Italy, despite averaging higher than Greece, shows greater volatility, increasing uncertainty.

### 5.2 Monte Carlo Simulations (Country-Level)

Worst simulated average FDI:

- Greece â€“ 1.18%
- Italy â€“ 1.19%
- USA â€“ 1.74%
- France â€“ 2.11%
- Germany â€“ 2.55%

**Insight:** Simulated results confirm weak attractiveness for FDI in historically low-performing countries.

### 5.3 Alert System (Oracle Triggers)

When simulated FDI drops below a threshold, alerts are inserted into `alertas_simulacion`.

Worst simulated values detected:

- Netherlands â€“ -78.06%
- Belgium â€“ -47.98%
- Ireland â€“ -43.49%

**Interpretation:** Extreme drops indicate structural fragility or high sensitivity in the projection model.

### 5.4 Company-Level Z-Score Risk

**High Risk (Z < 1.0):**

- DataMotion (CHN) â€“ Z: 0.63
- Oceanix (DEU) â€“ Z: 0.63
- QuantumEdge (IRL) â€“ Z: 0.65
- TechNova (USA) â€“ Z: 0.87

**Low Risk:**

- Solaria (USA) â€“ Z: 42.42
- InverPlus (IRL) â€“ Z: 2.55

**Note:** Altman Z-Score simulated per company using Oracle + sensitivity adjustments.

### 5.5 Z-Score Alert System (Triggers)

Companies with Z-Score < 1.8 triggered automated alerts in the database.

| Company     | Country | Z-Score | Message                    |
| ----------- | ------- | ------- | -------------------------- |
| DataMotion  | CHN     | 0.63    | âš  Below critical threshold |
| Oceanix     | DEU     | 0.63    | âš  Below critical threshold |
| QuantumEdge | IRL     | 0.65    | âš  Below critical threshold |
